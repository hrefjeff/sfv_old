## Gardening
Writing about how when I was gardening, I had 10 plants that died.
But then looked up and saw the other 117 plants I planted were thriving.

## Include books
 * The 5 Rings
     * Taught me about the different aspects of strategy.
 * Creative Quest
     * Taught the importance of meditation. Quest love meditates ~30min a day. Bruce Lee did too. Almost all the greats do it.
 * Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
     * Taught me how to begin a sentence with, "I am currently struggling with..." instead of "I can't..."
       For example, saying something like "I can't deal with ~insert character's annoying move here~" lends itself to pinning yourself into a corner. Instead, I rephrase the sentence like, "I am currently struggling with ~insert character's annoying move here~". That sentence sets the mind to interpret the situation as something you can grow from. Mainly because of the word "currently". Current = now. And just because it's happening now, doesn't mean it always will be. You can grow.
       In order to be successful, I believe you need to have the idea that you can cultivate a skill. If you just outright say

## How I went about getting better

Recently had a friend (yizzzy) refer me to a vidjya on getting better. I've seen bits and pieces of it but decided to compare this list to how I try to get better. So the video is 7 tips for improving in SFV and the link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7qFzQF9Iw8

Here's a summary of how I personally go about doing these things (or need to start doing): 

1. Study your replays

  I definitely do this by going to CFN and watching replays with both key display and frame data on.
  One thing I could do better though is analyze buttons the opponent is pressing on wakeup or when they get counter hit.
  Generally though, I take Frame Advantages approach when analyzing my matches (video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJV-K0rLOC0 ). Tyrant and Packz say to answer these 3 questions:
  * How did I take damage?
  * I can I optimize my damage?
  * How did I get into the bad situation in the first place?

2. Search for replays

    I always make sure to look at people who are better than me. I believe it useful to find someone who is a little bit more skillful than you rather than a very wide skill gap. This is because you as a player will not automagically ingest all the information that comes from a player's movement but just looking at them. Basically, the player with a large skill gap from yours will have too much going on that you are not be prepared to understand yet. This is opposed to watching a replay from a player with slight/moderate difference in skill that you can learn from because you'll notice them getting into situtations more like the ones you'll be put in.
    
3. Find a favorite to learn from

4. Muscle memory drills
5. Learn matchups in detail
6. Sharpen reactions
7. Take notes/set goals

Other things I did. Get social. Join a discord. Find a google doc that is maintained by a community about a specific character ( like the r mika bible https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBEIXYX51TmdEZ_nh6dydHxJXwED7kZNsfLKENanca0/ or the ryu bible _get link_ )
