## Gardening
Writing about how when I was gardening, I had 10 plants that died.
But then looked up and saw the other 117 plants I planted were thriving.

 * The 5 Rings
     * Taught me about the different aspects of strategy.

     * Taught the importance of meditation. Quest love meditates ~30min a day. Bruce Lee did too. Almost all the greats do it.
 * Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
     * Taught me how to begin a sentence with, "I am currently struggling with..." instead of "I can't..."
       For example, saying something like "I can't deal with ~insert character's annoying move here~" lends itself to pinning yourself into a corner. Instead, I rephrase the sentence like, "I am currently struggling with ~insert character's annoying move here~". That sentence sets the mind to interpret the situation as something you can grow from. Mainly because of the word "currently". Current = now. And just because it's happening now, doesn't mean it always will be. You can grow.
       In order to be successful, I believe you need to have the idea that you can cultivate a skill. If you just outright say

## How I went about getting better at Street Fighter 5

In a previous post I made it a goal to explain something I didn't understand when I first started SF5. So today's topic will be "How to improve in SF5" since it is one of the things I had. The aim of this goal has 2 parts. First, by sharing my personal experience of banging my head against a wall, I will hopefully save some bruises for whoever else is going through the same process. Secondly, it is an evaluation of myself to see if I'm using all of my resources to get better.

Recently, my friend [yizzzy](https://twitter.com/YichiYen) shared a video with me on getting better in Street Fighter 5. It's called "7 Tips For Improving In SFV" and can be found by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7qFzQF9Iw8). In my time with SF5 I have touched on each one of these points at least once and I'd like to share my experiences with each step and put my 2 cents in on the topics.

So without further ado, here's a summary of how I personally went about getting better at SF5 using the points from the video as a guideline: 

0. GO TO YOUR LOCAL FIGHTING GAME MEETUPS!

    This isn't in the video but I had to find somewhere early to stress this.

1. Study your replays

  I wholeheartedly agree with doing this because of the great job Capcom has done with SFV's replay abilities. I'll constantly go on CFN (capcom fighter's network) and watch replays with both of the options "_key display_" and "_frame data_" turned on. Just like in the video, I believe replays of your losses provide you a great basis for what you can work on. I believe Chris Tatarian (a SoCal Ken player) does this thing where he searches for a replay of his that dates back to to a couple weeks prior so he is kind of looking at the replay with a fresh pair of eyes.
  
  But Jeffrey, what am I looking for in my a replays? Glad you asked! I'll analyze my game by watching my replay in 2 phases. The first time I watch the replay, I'll watch it full speed and without interruption/pauses to get a wholistic view of what's going on in the match. Then I'll watch it a 2nd time and target any specific details I could work on. The details I target, or find most important in getting better, is by using [Frame Advantages' approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJV-K0rLOC0). So I'll do what Tyrant and Packz recommend which is to answer these 3 questions when watching the replays:
  * How did I take damage?
  * I can I optimize my damage?
  * How did I get into the bad situation in the first place?

2. Search for replays

    I always make sure to look at people who are better than me. I believe it useful to find someone who is a little bit more skillful than you rather than a very wide skill gap. This is because you as a player will not automagically ingest all the information that comes from a player's movement but just looking at them. Basically, the player with a large skill gap from yours will have too much going on that you are not be prepared to understand yet. This is opposed to watching a replay from a player with slight/moderate difference in skill that you can learn from because you'll notice them getting into situtations more like the ones you'll be put in.
    
    If you're having trouble developing a strategy against a certain character, yo ass better get on Youtube!! Search "Street fighter 5 _**insert your character name here**_ vs _**insert other character name here**_". There are plenty of players who are eager to upload their highlights of them bodying some characters. Also, CFN has this cool feature in game where you can filter by character and league points. Super helpful.
    
3. Find a favorite to learn from

    This is so helpful it's not even funny. There is a someone better than you and outworking you. Learn a lesson from them. I, myself, subscribe to a bunch of people and join their twitch streams/discord chats all the time. It's good to jump out of your little bubble and get an outside perspective. This gets into the "social" aspect of the game where I describe later.

4. Muscle memory drills

    I stay in training mode. It's a very useful tool to practice muscle memory. In my opinion you're never too good to go back to fundamentals. All the greatest individuals that practice their craft will practice day 1 stuff so it becomes second nature and not have to think about it when the situation arises. So before a ranked grind session or tournament, I'll do something called laps by opening up training mode and simply dashing across the stage 10 times. 5 times to the left, 5 times to the right. It'll get you loose. Then I'll practice my bread-n-butter combos. Then I'll practice meaty setups. I'll do each movement 10 times in a row and if I drop a combo or moveset before I hit 10, I'll start the counter back at 1.

5. Learn matchups in detail

    I don't do this to the extent I should. It is definitely something I can work on. There's levels to everything but this is one where you can go deep down the rabit hole. In general start with yourself and your character. What moves are plus on block? How does your hurtbox behave when throwing out a certain move? At what range does your character operate the most effective? Answering these questions will help you develop a sense of self-awareness on what you should and shouldn't do.
    
    Then you can go on down the list of opponenents and for each one figure out how your character can responsd with when they throw out their array of moves. It should get to the point where you can automatically recognize what buttons you should and should not press and how you can use characters strengths to overcome the opponent. Be like water.

6. Sharpen reactions

    This is another thing I need to work on. Go the the lab and set the dummy to either jump in, walk in, press a button, or do a special move. Challenge yourself to counter or successfully nullify their movements consistently.

7. Take notes/set goals

    The way I take notes is with a journal. I'll make notes of my performance at the end of the day so I can visually keep track of my progress/mistakes. When all the details are in the head, it's hard to reflect upon. You have to get it out on paper. Or even in a blog, similar to the one I'm writing for you to read right now.
    
    This can help in setting goals. My goals in the beginning were to cut bad habits a small amount at a time. If I'm getting countered alot, stop pressing a button or doing the move and evaluate why I'm getting hit. Your goals will take you beyond when it's time to perform against other folks. I enter into tournaments all the time to evaluate what I've been working on. Reddit hosts an online tournment every Monday. I do this as a measure of what I've been working on. It helps me get better by giving me something to say "I'm not going to get bodied by the same move that bodied me last week." Which over a course of time, I get still get bodied, but not in the same way. And the more times I get bodied, the less I will get bodied since I've put myself in the situation.
    
    There's something I should add about responsibility and holding yourself accountable for your actions eventually. You can ask questions all day, but being dependent yourself without relying on the phrase "I haven't learned that" only can take you so far.
    
Other things I did. Get social. Join a discord. Find a google doc that is maintained by a community about a specific character ( like the r mika bible https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBEIXYX51TmdEZ_nh6dydHxJXwED7kZNsfLKENanca0/ or the ryu bible _get link_ )
