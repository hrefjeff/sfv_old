## Gardening
Writing about how when I was gardening, I had 10 plants that died.
But then looked up and saw the other 117 plants I planted were thriving.

# CEO 2019

## Ricky Ortiz Match

Dansetsu explained to us about small victories. He spoke about his st.mk w/ sagat which leads to opponent making irrational decisions to get around the problem. Mainly jumping or dashing. I also got baited out alot to jump when Ricky used st.hp and st.mp. 

## Loser's Semi vs Akuma

### Game 1

Lost it

#### Round 1

Got jumped in on 3 times w/o punishing it. Not even a cr.HP.

#### Round 2

Throws started working then I randomly abandonded the tactic

## Game 2

Won it

Akuma's target combo st.HP -> st.HP put him out of range of cr.mp -> cr.mk -> tenko. Should just do cr.mk -> tenko.

### Game 3

Lost it

I back teched 3 times in a row. Need to start mixing up the wake up options.

Generally my meaties were off.

# EVO 2019

Antolin called me out on something that allowed some concepts to finally click. "You're trying to do something without setting it up." Mainly, I was trying to shimmy without establishing a throw game. This lead into me thinking about how I try to whiff punish things without establishing that I'm pressing buttons to try to bait them into throwing out a heavy button.

I played Persia (a good ken player). He 10-0'd me. I learned alot though. Mainly about spacing and buffering. He used st.lk and buffered into ex.tatsu. Even though I knew what he was looking for, he still punished me for whiffing in front of his face. What I needed to do was walk up and do nothing. I'd bounce in and out of range and always press when I come back in. Gonna try bouncing in and out and then just waiting.
