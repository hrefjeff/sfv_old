## Gardening
Writing about how when I was gardening, I had 10 plants that died.
But then looked up and saw the other 117 plants I planted were thriving.

 * Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
     * Taught me how to begin a sentence with, "I am currently struggling with..." instead of "I can't..."
       For example, saying something like "I can't deal with ~insert character's annoying move here~" lends itself to pinning yourself into a corner. Instead, I rephrase the sentence like, "I am currently struggling with ~insert character's annoying move here~". That sentence sets the mind to interpret the situation as something you can grow from. Mainly because of the word "currently". Current = now. And just because it's happening now, doesn't mean it always will be. You can grow.
       In order to be successful, I believe you need to have the idea that you can cultivate a skill. If you just outright say

## How I went about getting better

I recently had a friend (yizzzy) refer me to some videos on getting better in Street Fighter 5. The video is called, "7 Tips For Improving In SFV" and can be found by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7qFzQF9Iw8). In my time with SF5 I have touched on each one of these points at least once and I'd like to share my experiences with each step and put my 2 cents in why and how to follow these steps.

So without further ado, here's a summary of how I personally went about getting better at SF5 using the points from the video as a guideline: 

1. Study your replays

  I definitely do this because of the sheer convinience going on CFN and watching replays with both "_key display_" and "_frame data_" on. One thing I could do better though is to analyze buttons my opponent is pressing on wakeup or when they get counter hit. I believe Chris T. goes back to his replays he played a couple weeks prior so he is kind of looking at the replay with a fresh pair of eyes. 
  
  I'll analyze my game in 2 phases when I watch a replay of my game. The first time I watch the replay, I'll watch it full speed and without interruption/pauses to get a wholistic view of what's going on in the match. Then I'll watch it a 2nd time and target any specific details I could work on.
  
  The specific details I draw from my replays are by following [Frame Advantages' approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJV-K0rLOC0). So I'll do what Tyrant and Packz recommend which is to answer these 3 questions when watching the replays:
  * How did I take damage?
  * I can I optimize my damage?
  * How did I get into the bad situation in the first place?

2. Search for replays

    I always make sure to look at people who are better than me. I believe it useful to find someone who is a little bit more skillful than you rather than a very wide skill gap. This is because you as a player will not automagically ingest all the information that comes from a player's movement but just looking at them. Basically, the player with a large skill gap from yours will have too much going on that you are not be prepared to understand yet. This is opposed to watching a replay from a player with slight/moderate difference in skill that you can learn from because you'll notice them getting into situtations more like the ones you'll be put in.
