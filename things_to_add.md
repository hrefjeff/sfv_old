 * The 5 Rings
     * Taught me about the different aspects of strategy.
 * Creative Quest
     * Taught the importance of meditation. Quest love meditates ~30min a day. Bruce Lee did too. Almost all the greats do it.
 * Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
     * Taught me how to begin a sentence with, "I am currently struggling with..." instead of "I can't..."
       For example, saying something like "I can't deal with ~insert character's annoying move here~" lends itself to pinning yourself into a corner. Instead, I rephrase the sentence like, "I am currently struggling with ~insert character's annoying move here~". That sentence sets the mind to interpret the situation as something you can grow from. Mainly because of the word "currently". Current = now. And just because it's happening now, doesn't mean it always will be. You can grow.
       In order to be successful, I believe you need to have the idea that you can cultivate a skill. If you just outright say

* Relentless
    * Samurai's book recommendation. The author was Kobe Bryant's trainer, along with Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Dwayne wade and many other professional athletes. He gives his account about what he believes it takes to be a "cleaner". Which is different thant a "cooler" or a "closer".

## Ricky Ortiz Match

Dansetsu explained to us about small victories. He spoke about his st.mk w/ sagat which leads to opponent making irrational decisions to get around the problem. Mainly jumping or dashing. I also got baited out alot to jump when Ricky used st.hp and st.mp. 

## Loser's Semi vs Akuma

### Game 1

Lost it

#### Round 1

Got jumped in on 3 times w/o punishing it. Not even a cr.HP.

#### Round 2

Throws started working then I randomly abandonded the tactic

## Game 2

Won it

Akuma's target combo st.HP -> st.HP put him out of range of cr.mp -> cr.mk -> tenko. Should just do cr.mk -> tenko.

### Game 3

Lost it

I back teched 3 times in a row. Need to start mixing up the wake up options.

Generally my meaties were off.
