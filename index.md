I just got to 4,500LP. I couldn't have done it without the help of Huntsville's Fighting Game Community. Up in this rank, everyone is trying to get their shimmy on. It's bombaclat.

I play alotta Street Fighter 5 and I'm maining Ryu at the moment. I play on PlayStation 4 (psn: jiggabeffrey, cfn: Boombahyay). The plan is to transition to PC within the next couple of months (steam name: Buttnekkid) and eventually make my salt public by streaming it on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
