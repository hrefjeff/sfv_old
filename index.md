## How I went about getting better at Street Fighter 5
### 2019-05-15

I made it a goal in a previous post to explain something I didn't understand when I first started SF5. So today's topic will be "How to improve in SF5" since it is one of the things I am continuously trying to get my head wrapped around. The aim of this goal has 2 parts. First, by sharing my personal experience of banging my head against a wall I will hopefully save some else some bruises along the way in this process. Secondly, it is an evaluation of myself to see if I'm using all of my resources to get better.

Recently, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/YichiYen" target="_blank">yizzzy</a> shared a video with me on getting better in Street Fighter 5. It's called "7 Tips For Improving In SFV" and can be found by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7qFzQF9Iw8" target="_blank">here</a>. In my time with SF5 I have touched on each one of these points at least once and I'd like to share my experiences with each step and put my 2 cents in on the topics. Overview of topics:

  Step 0. [GO TO YOUR LOCAL FIGHTING GAME MEETUPS!](#head0)<br>
  Step 1. [Study your replays](#head1)<br>
  Step 2. [Search for replays](#head2)<br>
  Step 3. [Find a favorite to learn from](#head3)<br>
  Step 4. [Muscle memory drills](#head4)<br>
  Step 5. [Learn matchups in detail](#head5)<br>
  Step 6. [Sharpen your reactions](#head6)<br>
  Step 7. [Take notes/set goals](#head7)<br>
  Step 8. [Accept responsibility](#head8)<br>
  Step 9. [Other things or stuff that deserve a whole post on their own](#head9)<br>

So without further ado, here's a summary of how I personally went about getting better at SF5 using the points from the video as a guideline: 

### <a name="head0"></a>Step 0. GO TO YOUR LOCAL FIGHTING GAME MEETUPS!

This isn't in the video but I had to find a place somewhere early on in this post to stress this. Shoutouts to the SFV players like _**TODO: Add twitter links**_ Tajh, Caleb, Dalian, Henry, Jeffery, and alot of others in my local fight scene for teaching me about fighting games in general.

### <a name="head1"></a>Step 1. Study your replays

I wholeheartedly agree with studying replay of yourself because of the great job Capcom has done with SFV's replay cabilities. I'll constantly go to CFN (capcom fighter's network) in the game and watch replays with both of the options "_key display_" and "_frame data_" turned on. Watching replays of your losses provided me a great basis for what I needed to work on. I recently learned Chris Tatarian (a SoCal Ken player) where he searches for one of his past replays that dates back to to a couple days or weeks prior to help him get an objective outlook on a replay. I was amazed by how many tendencies I found that I didn't know I had.
  
"But Jeffrey, what am I supposed to be looking for in my a replays!?" I'm glad you asked! I'll analyze my game by watching my replay in 2 phases. The first time I watch the replay, I'll watch it full speed and without interruption/pauses to get a wholistic view of what's going on in the match. Then I'll watch it a 2nd time and target any specific details I could work on. The details I find most important and helpful in getting better is by using 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJV-K0rLOC0" target="_blank">Frame Advantages' approach</a>. So I'll do what Tyrant and Packz recommend which is to answer these 3 questions when watching the replays:
  * How did I take damage?
  * I can I optimize my damage?
  * How did I get into the bad situation in the first place?

### <a name="head2"></a>2. Search for replays

I always make sure to find people who are more skilled than I am. When I started out with SF5 I would search for all the godlike players in the game and try to learn from them. What I ended up finding out myself is that I improved the most when I started viewing replays of someone who is a little bit or moderately more skilled relative to where I was. When I would watch replays of high level players (Grand masters and above when I was a rookie/bronze player), they would make decisions and movements that were completely out of context to me. I couldn't follow their rationale. However, when I started watching replays from a player that was slightly/moderately more skilled than I was I would be able to recognize the flow situtations. It started becoming a conversation of "Oh snap, I see what he did there. That's smart." Or "Oh they dun goofed. Let's see what play they make to recover."
    
If I'm having trouble developing a strategy against a certain character or generally struggling with a match up, I get my ass on Youtube!! Search "Street fighter 5 <u>_**insert your character name here**_</u> vs <u>_**insert other character name here**_"</u>. There are plenty of players who are eager to upload their highlights of them bodying other characters that you can learn from. Also, CFN has this cool search feature in game where you can filter replays by character and league points. It's super helpful and wish I had known about it sooner.
    
### <a name="head3"></a>3. Find a favorite to learn from

Until we are winning premiere and major tournmanets there is always someone better than you and out-hussling you. Learn a lesson from them. I, myself, subscribe to a bunch of people and join their twitch streams/discord chats all the time. It's good practice to view the ways of the world and get an outside perspective. This gets into the social aspect of the game where I describe later.

### <a name="head4"></a>4. Muscle memory drills

Training mode. Training mode. Training mode. It's a very powerful tool to build MUSCLE POWER... err... I mean muscle memory. In my opinion you're never too good to go back to fundamentals. All the greatest individuals that practice their craft will practice day 1 stuff so it becomes second nature so they won't have to think about it when the situation arises. 

So before a ranked grind session or tournament, I'll do something called laps by opening up training mode and simply dashing across the stage 10 times. 5 times to the left and 5 times to the right. It gets me loose. Then I'll practice my bread-n-butter (b-n-b) combos. I'll do each combo 10 times in a row and if I drop a combo before I hit 10, I'll start the counter back at 1. Then I'll practice meaty setups. I'll do the same 10 reps in a row as the b-n-b combos. I'll also do some hit confirm training where I set the training dummy on "block random" and practice stopping my combo short if they block or continuing it if they do not block.

### <a name="head5"></a>5. Learn matchups in detail

I don't do this to the extent I should. It is definitely something I can work on. There are levels to everything but this is one where you can go deep down the rabit hole. I'd generally start with myself and my character. What attacks are plus on block? How does my hurtbox behave when throwing out a certain move? At what range does my character operate most effectively? Answering these questions will help you develop a sense of self-awareness on what you should and shouldn't do.
    
Then I'll go on down the list of opponenents I have faced and for each one figure out how my character can respond with when they throw out their array of moves. It should get to the point where you can automatically recognize what buttons you should rely on most and how you can use characters strengths to overcome the opponent. I recently learned more about the Karin Vs. Laura matchup. Laura has to play very risky because her buttons are not as good as Karin's in the neautral range. So they'll dash and overhead more than usual in order to get a knock down.

### <a name="head6"></a>6. Sharpen reactions

This is another thing I need to work on. Go the the lab and set the dummy to either jump in, walk in, press a button, or do a special move. Challenge yourself to counter or successfully nullify their movements consistently.

### <a name="head7"></a>7. Take notes/set goals

The way I take notes is with a journal. I'll make notes of my performance at the end of the day so I can visually keep track of my progress/mistakes. When all the details are in the head, it's hard to reflect upon. You have to get it out on paper. Or even in a blog, similar to the one I'm writing for people to read right now.
    
So taking notes and writing things down can help in setting goals. My goals in the beginning were things like consistenly land a punish combo. If I'm getting countered alot, stop pressing a button or doing the move and evaluate why I'm getting hit. Your goals will make you a stronger player when it's time to perform against other folks. I enter into tournaments all the time to evaluate what I've been working on. Reddit hosts an online tournment every Monday. I do this as a measure of what I've been working on. Everyone is different though. Competition is not everything. It is just my ninja way.
    
### <a name="head8"></a>8. Accept responsibility
 
This isn't in the video and I won't speak too much on this subject. I just believe it is worth mentioning. I try to accept responsibility and holding myself accountable for my own decisions and actions. I ask questions all day but relying on the phrase "I haven't learned that yet" or "No one told me about that" only took me so far. I play my game with the philosphy of, "Play as if you are a master, but learn like you are a student."

### <a name="head9"></a>9. Other things or stuff that deserve a whole post on their own
    
Get social. Join a discord. Find a google doc that is maintained by a community about a specific character (like the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBEIXYX51TmdEZ_nh6dydHxJXwED7kZNsfLKENanca0/" target="_blank">R.Mika bible</a>).

## Money Match at the Local (Post-fight)
### 2019-04-12

WWWwwelp. I lost. 4-5. I was up 4-1 at one point and then I blew it. I watched the replay. I started deviating from the game plan. In the matches leading up to the end I fell back to bad habits. Random Ex.Peach, not low profiling the drop kick with cr.mk, getting baited into the corner. All that jazz.

We live to fight another day. It's not about how hard you hit though, it's about how hard you can take a hit and get back up. So I ask myself these simple questions: How are you going to respond to this? Will you learn this time?

#### My plan

Cultivate and practice better habits that become second nature to me. What I am currently practicing is not setting me up for how I want to grow as a SFV player at all. So:

- Stop mashing 3 frame buttons to bail me out of situations
- Start being aware of adaptations and develop a new plan (by asking myself questions like how am I taking damage? How am I dealing damage? What will the opponent do in this situation that have already been in?)
- Be _patient_ by avoiding large movements (such as dash up grab/3f) when my health is below 20%.

2 biggest lessons from last night:

- Frame data isn't everything. But it sure does help.
- Probably the biggest lesson over all though is from the moment I remembered a story in the second round of the game where the score was 4-4, where I'm looking at the opponents 100% health bar versus my 25%:

#### The Boiling Frog

The boiling frog is a fable describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.

Adaptation and awareness is key. The journey continues!

## Money Match at the Local (Pre-fight)
### 2019-04-11
<a href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/98f9206f14232c2589e1e82863a8a9da/tenor.gif?itemid=4575322" target="_blank">OOOOOOOOO BOIIIIIIII TODAY IS THE DAYYY!!!</a> THE DAY OF THE MONEY MATCH IN SFV! It will be FT5 between me, Buttnaked, versus the infamous Nikos. The 2 R.Mikas of Huntsville Alabama. It'll be Cincuenta Cincuenta's at its finest. Not only is it for the money ($50), but also for the most important thing. THE RIGHTS TO TALK THAT TRASH! WHO'S GONNA GUESS RIGHT TONIGHT!?

This is a special occasion because I've been playing this game for roughly a little over year. I spent even less time at my local scene. But when I first arrived at my local (which is at Lucky Dice cafe every thursday), one of the first people I ran into was a dude named Nikos. Every thursday he would beat me silly. HOWEVER! It hasn't been until recently where I consistently beat him. He hasn't recognized that so I had to call him out.

Here are some of my notes on how I'll be approaching the match up and collecting my prize tonight:

### R.Mika Mirror Match

#### General things I'll keep in mind

<ol>
<li>CR.MK THE DROPKICK!!! Low profiling the dropkick is essential in this match up</li>
<li>Play patient when in neutral. Watch for the general 4 tendencies of getting in:</li><br>
<pre>
  1. Dash
  2. Jump (splash)
  3. Charged dropkick
  4. Stand mp -> ex peach
</pre>
<li>Take the landing frame throws. They'll most likely be brimstones, so backdash.</li>
<li>When he calls nadeshiko then I'll call nadeshiko. Otherwise, count to 3 and jump diagonally.</li>
<li>st.mk to counter wake up CA</li>
<li>Mix in regular throws from time to time</li>
</ol>

#### Defensive options

<ol>
  <li>Charged dropkick</li>
<pre>
  1. PRE  - low profile with cr.mk
  2. PRE  - walk+quick attack
  3. PRE  - backdash to force whiff
  4. PRE  - Jump in (divebomb)
  5. POST - Guess Right
</pre>
  <li>Dive bomb</li>
<pre>
  1. block
  2. dash under
  3. wingless airplane
</pre>
  <li>st.mk</li>
<pre>
  1. st.mk
  2. cr.mk
  3. ex.peach
</pre>
  <li>st.mp ---> *MAAAAAASH*</li>
  <li>f.hp  ---> st.lk after blocking this. It shifts the hitbox back and avoids st.mp frametrap and cmd grabs</li>
  <li>brimstone --> backdash</li>
  <li>ex-peach --> Back tech + walkback. If I notice a chasedown coming, I'll neutral tech + mash cr.lp</li>
</ol>
  
#### Offensive options

<ol>
  <li>cr.mk --> V-trigger activate. Everybody and they mama cr.hp and activate, but it can wiff and your S.O.L.</li>
  <li>Walking + blocking. Cuz we ain't no bitch. In the corner especially.</li>
  <li>Fake pressure when I have conditioned accordingly</li>
  <li>Tick-throws!!</li>
<pre>
  1. st.lk --> cmd
  2. st.lp --> st. lp --> ex.swing
  3. st.lk --> cr.lk --> ex.brimestone
  4. st.lk --> microwalk --> cr.lp --> microwalk --> reg.grab
</pre>
  <li>Oki situations</li>
<pre>
  1. brimstone (corner)    --> st.lp --> f.HP --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
  2. brimstone (midscreen) --> dash --> (+2) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
  3. peach                 --> dash --> (+2) st.lp --> st.lp --> st.mp
  4. ex.peach              --> dash --> (+1) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> f.HP
</pre>
  <li>If there is wake up V-trigger, and I'm pressing a button, cancel into WA or EX.peach</li>
</ol>

#### The nootch (I'll probably take the Joey900 approach)

<ol>
  <li>NOT get baited into the corner. The ol' walk back and then do a back throw or something is strong.</li>
  <li>Walk + block. Until he starts poking to counter that. Then I counter poke. Then he'll start approaching. Then I'll poke. On and on and on</li>
  <li>Whiff safe moves like st.lk, st.lp, and sprinkle in random uncharged drop kicks.</li>
</ol>  

Oh. Btw. Just got Karin to Platinum (7500LP).

## Thoughts after a year
### 2019-03-28

Soooo. It's been a while. And I'm looking back at these past couple of notes and it's still enough to leave me in tears from laughter. Mainly because I'm still a noob.

Points-wise, I'm at 20k with my main account, where I primarily use R.Mika. I recently began another account and main Karin Kanzuki on that one. It has taken me 2 weeks to get to 5.5k perntz. I'm starting to get my shimmy on now too ( <a href="https://media.eventhubs.com/images/2016/05/28_valleface04t.jpg" target="_blank">evil laugh</a> ).

I'm reflecting upon what has happened since the last entry of this little blog. Thinking about all the tournaments I've participated in, people I've gotten to meet and train with, lessons I've learned, and the overall time I have put into this game. I can honestly say I have no ragrets. SFV has been a wild ride.

Goals for now:
  1. Earn Diamond rank (14,000LP) with Ms. Kanzuki and run the set with Yi.
  2. Write at least 1 helpful guide targeted toward a concept in SFV that I didn't understand the first go around. (Potentially meaty attacks?)
  3. Get my plane ticket for EVO2019!

I just got to 4,500LP. I couldn't have done it without the help of Huntsville's Fighting Game Community. Up in this rank, everyone is trying to get their shimmy on. It's bombaclat.

LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAWD. There goes the peace and quiet -_-

## Intro
### 2018-02-09

I play alotta Street Fighter 5 and I'm maining Ryu at the moment. I play on PlayStation 4 (psn: jiggabeffrey, cfn: Boombahyay). The plan is to transition to PC within the next couple of months (steam name: Buttnekkid) and eventually make my salt public by streaming it on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
