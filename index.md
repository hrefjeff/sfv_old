## Money Match at the Local (Pre-fightf)
### 2019-04-11
<a href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/98f9206f14232c2589e1e82863a8a9da/tenor.gif?itemid=4575322" target="_blank">OOOOOOOOO BOIIIIIIII TODAY IS THE DAYYY!!!</a> THE DAY OF THE MONEY MATCH IN SFV! It will be me, Buttnaked, versus the infamous Nikos. The 2 R.Mikas of Huntsville Alabama. It'll be Cincuenta Cincuenta's at its finest. Not only is it for the money ($50), but also for the most important thing. THE RIGHTS TO TALK THAT TRASH! WHO'S GONNA GUESS RIGHT TONIGHT!?

This is a special occasion because I've been playing this game for roughly a little over year. I spent even less time at my local scene. But when I first arrived at my local (which is at Lucky Dice cafe every thursday), one of the first people I ran into was a dude named Nikos. Every thursday he would beat me silly. HOWEVER! It hasn't been until recently where I consistently beat him. He hasn't recognized that so I had to call him out.

Here are some of my notes on how I'll be approaching the match up and collecting my winnings tonight:

### R.Mika Mirror Match

#### General things I'll keep in mind

<ol>
  <li>CR.MK THE DROPKICK!!! Low profiling the dropkick is essential in this match up</li>
  <li>Play patient when in neutral. Generally 4 ways to get in:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Dash</li>
    <li>Jump (splash)</li>
    <li>Charged dropkick</li>
    <li>Stand mp -> ex peach</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Take the landing frame throws. They'll most likely be brimstones, so backdash.</li>
  <li>When he calls nadeshiko then I'll call nadeshiko. Otherwise, count to 3 and jump diagonally.</li>
  <li>st.mk to counter wake up CA</li>
  <li>Mix in regular throws from time to time</li>
</ol>

#### Defensive options

  1. Charged dropkick
        a. PRE  - cr.mk low profile
        b. PRE  - walk+quick attack
        c. PRE  - backdash to force whiff
        d. PRE  - Jump in (divebomb)
        e. POST - Guess Right
  2. Dive bomb
        a. block
        b. dash under
        c. wingless airplane
  3. st.mk
        a. st.mk
        b. cr.mk
        c ex.peach
  4. st.mp ---> *MAAAAAASH*
  5. f.hp  ---> st.lk after blocking this. It shifts the hitbox back and avoids st.mp frametrap and cmd grabs
  6. brimstone --> backdash
  7. ex-peach --> Back tech + walkback. If I notice a chasedown coming, I'll neutral tech + mash cr.lp
  
#### Offensive options

  1. cr.mk --> V-trigger activate. Everybody and they mama cr.hp and activate, but it can wiff and your SOL.
  2. Walking + blocking. Cuz we ain't no bitch. In the corner especially.
  3. Fake pressure when I notice more blocking
  3. Tick-throws!!
        * st.lk --> cmd
        * st.lp --> st. lp --> ex.swing
        * st.lk --> cr.lk --> ex.brimestone
  4. Oki situations
        * brimstone (corner)    --> st.lp --> f.HP --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
        * brimstone (midscreen) --> dash --> (+2) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> st.lp (x2) --> f.HP or cr.mp
        * peach                 --> dash --> (+2) st.lp --> st.lp --> st.mp
        * ex.peach              --> dash --> (+1) cr.lp --(if delayed)--> f.HP
  5. If there is wake up V-trigger, and I'm pressing a button, cancel into WA or EX.peach
      
#### The nootch (I'll probably take the Joey900 approach)

  1. NOT get baited into the corner. The ol' walk back and then do a back throw or something is strong.
  2. Walk + block. Until he starts poking to counter that. Then I counter poke. Then he'll start approaching. Then I'll poke. On and on and on
  3. Whiff safe moves like st.lk, st.lp, and sprinkle in random uncharged drop kicks.
      

Oh. Btw. Just got Karin to Platinum (7500LP).

## Thoughts after a year
### 2019-03-28

Soooo. It's been a while. And I'm looking back at these past couple of notes and it's still enough to leave me in tears from laughter. Mainly because I'm still a noob.

Points-wise, I'm at 20k with my main account, where I primarily use R.Mika. I recently began another account and main Karin Kanzuki on that one. It has taken me 2 weeks to get to 5.5k perntz. I'm starting to get my shimmy on now too ( <a href="https://media.eventhubs.com/images/2016/05/28_valleface04t.jpg" target="_blank">evil laugh</a> ).

I'm reflecting upon what has happened since the last entry of this little blog. Thinking about all the tournaments I've participated in, people I've gotten to meet and train with, lessons I've learned, and the overall time I have put into this game. I can honestly say I have no ragrets. SFV has been a wild ride.

Goals for now:
  1. Earn Diamond rank (14,000LP) with Ms. Kanzuki and run the set with Yi.
  2. Write at least 1 helpful guide targeted toward a concept in SFV that I didn't understand the first go around. (Potentially meaty attacks?)
  3. Get my plane ticket for EVO2019!

I just got to 4,500LP. I couldn't have done it without the help of Huntsville's Fighting Game Community. Up in this rank, everyone is trying to get their shimmy on. It's bombaclat.

## Intro
### 2018-02-09

I play alotta Street Fighter 5 and I'm maining Ryu at the moment. I play on PlayStation 4 (psn: jiggabeffrey, cfn: Boombahyay). The plan is to transition to PC within the next couple of months (steam name: Buttnekkid) and eventually make my salt public by streaming it on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
