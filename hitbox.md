# Hitbox Journal

I'm doing a 3 month long hitbox journey.
My mindset going in to this is that I'm going to lose alot in the beginning.
After 3 months have gone by I hope to figure out if I want to stick with it or stay on pad.

## Day 3 (Aug 8th, 2019)

### _Character Selection_

I decided to go with Ryu.
He's a basic bitch that has a moveset that overlaps with a majority of the cast.
So if I decide to go learn another character I'll have the basics down at least.
What I was originally going to do was either learn Zeku or Honda.
Zeku has 2 forms so essentially is learning 2 characters.
Honda is a charge character and I believe he'll be my 2nd or 3rd character I learn if I ever decide to.

### Summary

I could tell I felt a little more comfortable with the inputs.
Warm up with SFV currently:
  1. 50 fireballs each side
  1. 50 tatsu's each side
  1. BnB combos:
      1. cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp
      1. st.lp -> st.lp -> st.lk -> lk.donkey kick
      1. j.hk -> st.mp -> cr.hp -> hk.tatsu (mk.tatsu if close to corner)

I still mash though whenever I haven't thought about what move I want to do next.

## Day 2 (Aug 7th, 2019)

Everytime I waited on something today I practiced my 4+3 inputs.
Whether it was waiting on food, waiting at a red light, or waiting for an ad on a video to be done.

### _Taking Densetsu's advice_

I'm applying the first lesson and slowing it down to become familiar with it and speeding it up gradually.

Also, I started playing Hollow Knight.
It's a super dope side scrolling game and fits the hitbox perfectly.
Movement became easier within 30 minutes of playing.

## Day 1 (Aug 6th, 2019)

I used to play guitar for about a year so my left hand has some muscle memory of piano'ing inputs.
But for all intents and purposes of this journal I'll just give my experience on what I'm working on and how I'm going about getting better with a HB.

I tuned in to <a href="https://twitter.com/PianoDensetsu" target="_blank">Piano Densetsu's</a> stream.
He had some great advice on getting started with hitbox.
I asked him the question, "What do you wish you would have known when you first started using the hitbox?"
His reply was that he wish he knew more of how to practice.
He explained that when he doesn't have access to his hitbox,
he rested his hand on a flat surface and practiced lifting each finger up one at a time.
After a couple of days doing this should get more fluid (especially for the commonly problematic ring finger).
I've been doing this off and on but I plan on making this more consistent.

Also he stressed on practicing clean inputs.
So don't rush the inputs.
If I don't get something at first, I'll slow it down and steadily increase the speed.

Lastly, he said play a side scroller game and practice navigating menus.
You don't always have to just play street fighter to learn how to hitbox.

### _Biggest problem I found today_

I found out that walking and blocking on the player 2 side is hard for me.
The input is switching between 4 and 3 (or L and D+R).
I notice when I lift up my ring finger, my index finger is the first to go down followed by my middle finger.
