# Hitbox Journal

## Day 270 (May 4th, 2020)

I'm still going strong with the hitbox and I still enjoy playing on it! I've transitioned to a new character, which is the command character Zeku, and my inputs are getting cleaner. My biggest hurdle as of lately is removing bad habits. I have gotten accustomed to the instant dragon punch and am practicing to solely rely on regular dragon punches. Other than that, my training has differed only by increasing repititions during practice when I am struggling with a motion.

### How I practice now (Pomodoro technique is strong)

I look to Infexious, which is arguabley the best tournament zeku in the world right now that plays on pad, for advice on how to train. He says to repeat an action roughly 2000-3000 times to get it into your muscle memory. It's actually not that much work to do considering the benifits. To accomplish this efficiently I use the pomodoro technique to accomplish this.

The [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is essentially an interval timer. I'll set a timer for 1 minute to see how many of a certain move I can do. Then I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and continuously practice 1 thing. After the 10 minutes are up I'll take a 3 minute break. Rinse and repeat.

### Carpel Tunnel and hand pain

I never had any pains related to my wrist or arms as I've been going through this journey. One of the reasons I believe I've avoided this is because I'm constantly relaxed with my arm/wrist muscles during play. I also play with my hitbox angled slightly downwards so I'm not flexing anything.

## Day 3 (Aug 8th, 2019)

### _Character Selection_

I decided to go with Ryu.
He's a basic bitch that has a moveset that overlaps with a majority of the cast.
I believe that will help me be able to transition easily to whatever character I'd like to play next.
The original plan was to either learn Zeku or Honda.
In the interest of learning hitbox I thought it best to start with an easier character.

### _Today's Summary_

I could tell I felt a little more comfortable with the inputs.
Switching between 4 and 3 has become easier.
Warm up with SFV currently:
  1. 10 laps (dashing from one side of the stage to the other)
  1. 50 fireballs each side
  1. 50 tatsu's each side
  1. 50 cr.mk -> fireball each side
  1. 50 donkey kicks each side
  1. BnB combos:
      1. cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp
      1. st.lp -> st.lp -> st.lk -> lk.donkey kick
      1. st.mp -> st.mp -> tatsu
      1. st.mp -> st.mp -> ex.jordan kick -> h.dp
      1. j.hk -> st.mp -> cr.hp -> hk.tatsu (mk.tatsu if close to corner)
  1. 50 ex.fireball -> vt.activate -> dash -> h.dp
  1. 50 empty jump cross up -> cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp

I still mash though whenever I haven't thought through a combo.
Need to stop doing that!

## Day 2 (Aug 7th, 2019)

Everytime I waited on something today I practiced my 4+3 inputs.
Whether it was waiting on food, waiting at a red light, or waiting for an ad on a video to be done.

### _Taking Densetsu's advice_

I'm applying the first lesson and slowing it down to become familiar with it and speeding it up gradually.

Also, I started playing Hollow Knight.
It's a super dope side scrolling game and fits the hitbox perfectly.
Movement became easier within 30 minutes of playing.

## Day 1 (Aug 6th, 2019)

I tuned in to <a href="https://twitter.com/PianoDensetsu" target="_blank">Piano Densetsu's</a> stream.
He had some great advice on getting started with hitbox.
I asked him the question, "What do you wish you would have known when you first started using the hitbox?"
His reply was that he wish he knew more of how to practice.
He explained that when he doesn't have access to his hitbox,
he rested his hand on a flat surface and practiced lifting each finger up one at a time.
After a couple of days doing this should get more fluid (especially for the commonly problematic ring finger).
I've been doing this off and on but I plan on making this more consistent.

Also, he stressed on practicing clean inputs.
So don't rush the inputs.
If I don't get something at first, I'll slow it down and steadily increase the speed.

Lastly, he said play a side scroller game and practice navigating menus.
You don't always have to just play street fighter to learn how to hitbox.

### _Biggest problem I found today_

I found out that walking and blocking on the player 2 side is hard for me.
The input is switching between 4 and 3 (or L and D+R).
I notice when I lift up my ring finger, my index finger is the first to go down followed by my middle finger.

## Precursor

I've played on both pad and stick in the past.
I used to play guitar for about a year so my left hand has some muscle memory of piano'ing inputs.
I played trumpet and saxaphone too so my right hand has some muscle memory too.
For all intents and purposes of this journal I'll just give my experience on what I'm working on and how I'm going about getting better with a HB.

## Beginning

I'm doing a 3 month long hitbox journey.
My mindset going in to this is that I'm going to lose alot in the beginning.
After 3 months have gone by I hope to figure out if I want to stick with it or stay on pad.
