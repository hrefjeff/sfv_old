# Hitbox Journal

## Day 1

I used to play guitar for about a year so my left hand has some muscle memory of piano'ing inputs.
But for all intents and purposes of this journal I'll just give my experience on what I'm working on and how I'm going about getting better with a HB.

I hit up Piano Densetsu's stream. He had some great advice on getting started with hitbox.
I asked him the question "What do you wish you would have known when you first started using the hitbox?"
His reply was how to practice. So when he doesn't have access to the hitbox, he says just rest your hand on a flat surface,
and practice lifting each finger up one at a time. After a couple of days it should get more fluid (especially for the 
commonly problematic ring finger). I've been doing this off and on but I plan on making this more consistent.

Also he stressed on practicing clean inputs.
So don't rush the inputs and if I don't get something at first, just slow it down and steadily increase the speed.

I found out player 2 walking and blocking is hard for me. So the input is constantly switching between 4 and 3 (or L and D+R).
I notice when I lift up my ring finger, my index finger is the first to go down followed by my middle finger.
Will have to practice 

## Day 2

Everytime I waited on something today I practiced my 4+3 inputs.
Whether it was waiting on food, waiting at a red light, or waiting for an ad on a video to be done.
I'm applying the first lesson and slowing it down to become familiar with it and speeding it up gradually.
